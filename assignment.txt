1.How to create cell profile using gui?

Steps to Create a Cell Profile Using GUI (PMT):
Launch the Profile Management Tool (PMT):

Navigate to the bin directory of your WebSphere installation:

<WAS_HOME>/bin/ProfileManagement/pmt.sh (Linux/Unix)
<WAS_HOME>\bin\ProfileManagement\pmt.bat (Windows)

Start the Profile Creation Wizard:

Click on "Create" to start the profile creation wizard.

Select Profile Type:

Choose "Cell Profile".

This option will create a Deployment Manager profile and an application server profile, federated into a cell.

Configure Deployment Manager:

Provide:

Profile name (e.g., Dmgr01)

Path to store the profile


Configure Federated Application Server:

Provide:

Node name (e.g., AppSrv01)

Server name

Profile path for the federated application server


Click "Create" to start the profile creation process

Wait for Completion:

The tool will create both the Dmgr and the Application Server profiles and federate them into one cell.

Start Servers (Optional):

After creation, you can start the Deployment Manager and the federated application server.


2. Delete server.xml (AppSrv01/config/cells/cell-name/nodes/node-name/servers/server-name) and startserver ?

3. add some wrong entries in server.xml and startserver ?
ans: 
Issue : i am trying to start server but am not able to start server.
error: 
	file:///F:/WAS_ND_7.0/profiles/AppSrv01/config/cells/dmgrcell01/nodes/DESKTOP-LL81H7CNode01/servers/server1/server.xml:2:
           Content is not allowed in prolog., resulting from:
           org.xml.sax.SAXParseException: Content is not allowed in prolog.
		   
troubleshoot: 
		1. BOM (Byte Order Mark) issue: 
	If the XML file was edited in a text editor like Notepad or Notepad++, it may have accidentally inserted a hidden BOM character at the beginning.

	Fix: Open server.xml in a proper XML/text editor like Notepad++:
		Go to Encoding → Encode in UTF-8 without BOM
		Save the file.
	2. Unintended characters or whitespace before <server> tag
	3. Corrupted file
