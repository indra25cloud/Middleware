. what is profile?
 a profile is an environment, it contains admin console,cell,node,jvms and supporting configuration files which helps to do administrative activities on jvms and applications.
. jvms -- java virtual machines.

. diff types of profiles?
 there are 7 types of profiles in was 7.0 
	1. deployment manager profile
	2. application server profile
	3. custom or manages profile
	4. cell profile
	5. job manager profile
	6. admin agent profile
	7. secure proxy profile
From was 8.0 onwards a new profile is introduced 
	8. liberty profile.

.is it possible to stop dmgr profile in WAS-HOME directory?
 it's not directly possible to stop the dmgr profile from the WAS_HOME directory without navigating into the profile's bin directory or specifying the full path to the stop script.
 
. how to add a  particular node to dmgr?
goto profile_home/bin>addNode.sh hostname of dmgr SOAP connector portnumber of dmgr.
C:\Program Files (x86)\IBM\WebSphere\AppServer\profiles\AppSrv01\bin>addNode.bat localhost 8879 -includeapps	
## includeapps is for only application servers.	 

. how to start nodeagent?
profile-home/bin>startnode.bat
how to stop nodeagent?
profile_home/bin>stopnode.bat

. how to remove node from from dmgr cell by using cmd ?
goto profile-home/bin location then you must stop the node then execute removenode.bat script.
profile-home/bin>stopnode.bat
profile-home/bin>removenode.bat -force
then delete profile also becoze after removing the node we have no use of profile.so we need to delete.

. custom profile:
at the time of creating custom profile you dont get any servers.it will create with node only. later you must federate with dmgr cell.withoutdmgr cell custom profile is invalid/useless.its mandate to federate.

customprofile-home/bin>addNode.bat localhost 8879 

.synchronization 

the purpose of synchronization is to update the changes from cell to node.
to synchronize a node using cmd, first you need to stop the nodeagent.
profile-home/bin>stopnode.bat
profile-home/bin>syncNode.bat hostName of dmgr  SOAP portno of dmgr.

. how to change portnumber?
goto dmgr adminprofile start the server and goto admin console then system admin then deploymentmanager then click on ports hyperlink click on portname change portno click on ok then click on review click on sync and click on save.
then goto dmgrprofile home /config/cell/cellname/virtualhosts.xml edit here dmgr port no and save. this virtualhosts.xml file edit for dmgrprofile only. no need to edit for appserver profiles and custom profoles.
then restart the server.

. how to take backup without stopping servers.?
was-root\bin>backupconfig.bat -nostop 
## this script is going to take backup of default profile .

.if you want to take particular profile backup with particular location?
goto particular profile-home/bin location then execute the script.
------------or-------------------

	5. you are executing the command in wrong path
	6. if there are no permissions.
	7. if there is no sufficient disk space.
	8. if no sufficient heap memory
	9. not properly synchronized.
	10. if any jar files are missing.
	11. if there is not sufficient meta space.
	

. Webserver

Role of webserver..
	it will serve static files(html file)
	we can configure maintenance pages
	url re direction
	rewrite rules
	ssl certificates
	virtual host configuration
	it can forward the request to appserver.if appserver is integrated with IHS.

webserver integrate with appserver by using plugins only.

200tps - transaction per second.  
	
in environment we can configure without webserver also.
If the web server is configured, we can still get information from the web server even when the application server is down.
we will get server is under maintenance.
If the web server is not available, users may see a 500 Internal Server Error, which can be confusing and not user-friendly

There are 5 wsadmin objects
	 1. AdminControl - start/stop servers and monitoring servers.
	 2. AdminConfig - create jdbc driver,datasource,jms and update configuration
	 3. AdminApp - application deployment,uninstall,updating application backup.
	 4. adminTask - create servers,clusters,security updates.
	 5. Help - it helps to check the options and usage of each objects.

 what is Heap memory?
	Heap Memory is the portion of memory where the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) stores Java objects (heap objects) during program execution. 
	WebSphere uses the JVM to run Java EE applications. Every server (Dmgr, NodeAgent, AppServer) has its own heap settings.
You can configure these from:
	Admin Console → Servers > Server Types > WebSphere application servers > [your server] > Java and Process Management > Process Definition > Java Virtual Machine
	Or in shell via server.xml or startServer.sh arguments.
	
Key Heap Options:
	-Xms	Initial Heap Size — Memory JVM reserves at start.
	-Xmx	Maximum Heap Size — Max memory JVM can grow to.
	
		example: -Xms4096m -Xmx8192m

How Heap Works:
	1. When WAS starts, it allocates -Xms amount.
	2. As users interact with applications and objects are created, heap grows.
	3. If heap usage approaches the limit (-Xmx), Garbage Collector (GC) tries to clean up unused objects.
	4. If GC can't free enough memory, OutOfMemoryError occurs.

Internally, heap is divided into:
			Young Generation (Eden + Survivor spaces): Where new objects go first.
			Old Generation (Tenured space): Long-lived objects.
			Metaspace (or PermGen in old Java): Class metadata (not counted in -Xmx).
			
Problems with Heap Misconfiguration:
	-Xmx too low - 	OutOfMemoryError
	-Xms too high - Slow startup or crash

Memory Leak:
	A memory leak happens when your application keeps storing objects in memory but never releases them, even though they are no longer needed.
	This causes the heap memory to fill up slowly, eventually leading to OutOfMemoryError and server crash or hang.
	 
	 Impact of Memory Leak:
		Server becomes slow
		OutOfMemoryError
		
What is a Heap Dump?
	A heap dump is a snapshot of JVM's memory at a point in time — it shows all the objects that are currently in heap memory.
	It helps you analyze memory usage, find out:
		What objects are taking most memory
		Which objects are not being released,If there is a memory leak
		
How to Generate Heap Dump in WebSphere:
	Manually from Admin Console:
		Go to: Monitoring and Tuning > Performance Viewer > Current Activity
		Select your server
		Click Dump JVM Heap
		
	In jvm.options:
		-XX:+HeapDumpOnOutOfMemoryError
		-XX:HeapDumpPath=/opt/IBM/dumps/

How to uninstall Entire WAS setup ?
	1. Stop All Running Services
		# Stop WebSphere server (all profiles)
		cd /opt/IBM/WebSphere/AppServer/bin

		./stopManager.sh -profileName Dmgr01  # if it's ND version
		# Stop IBM HTTP Server
		/opt/IBM/HTTPServer/bin/apachectl stop
	2. Uninstall WebSphere, IHS, and Plugins Using uninstall Scripts
		/opt/IBM/InstallationManager/eclipse/tools/imcl listInstalledPackages -long
	Then uninstall each:
