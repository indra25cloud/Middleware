I am trying to start a server, but server is not starting. How to troubleshoot this issue.

=>If any files are missing, file not found exception
=>any directories got corrupted
=>If the syntax is wrong
=>If nodeagent is not started
=>You are executing the command in wrong path
=>If there are no permissions
=>If there is no sufficient disk space
=>If no sufficient heap memory
=>Not properly synchronized
=>If any jar files are missing, we will get class not found exceptions
=>if there is not sufficient meta space

Application
------------
An application is a collection of resources.
It contains
servlets, jsp, ejb, xml files, .properties, jar, images, java script, build together to fulfil business requirements

ex: Walmart.com, icicibank.com,amazon.in, onlinesbi.com,flipkart.com


Application Server
--------------------
An application server receives requests from end users, searches for the appropriate resources, executes the resources, and generates a response back to the end users. In appl servers like jboss, weblogic, websphere, we can deploy both .war file and .ear file

WebSphere Application Server - IBM
Jboss Application Server     - Redhat
WebLogic Application Server  - Oracle


Types of applications
-----------------------
1. Web Application : It contains servlets and jsp as the major components along with html files, images, xml files, java script, java classes and .properties. If it is a web application developers will build it as a .war file (web archive)
bookstore.war, medicalstore.war, appname.war 
2. Enterprise Application:
It contains servlets, jsp and EJBs like session beans, entity beans and message driven beans along with html files, images, xml files, java script, java classes and .properties. If an application have ejb components, developers will build it as a .ear file (enterprise archive)

Types of Installation
-----------------------
We can install WAS in 3 ways
	1. GUI mode
	2. imcl (from WAS 8.0)Installation Manager Command Line

what is  a profile
A profile is an environment, its contains AdminConsole, cell, node, servers and supporting configuration files which helps to do administration activities on servers and applications
What are different types of profiles
There are 7 types of profiles in WAS 7.0
	1. Deployment Manager Profile              dngr
	2. Application Server Profile              default template
	3. Custom Profile or managed profile       managed
	4. Cell Profile                            cell
	5. Job Manager Profile                     management
	6. Admin Agent Profile                     management
	7. Secure Proxy profile                    secureproxy
From WAS 8.0 onwards a new profile is introduced
	1. Deployment Manager Profile
	2. Application Server Profile
	3. Custom Profile or managed profile
	4. Cell Profile
	5. Job Manager Profile
	6. Admin Agent Profile
	7. Secure Proxy profile
	8. Liberty Profile

ex  AppSrv01/bin>startNode.sh
to stop nodeagent

Custom Profile Creation using command line
--------------------------------------------
manageprofiles.bat -create -profileName Custom01 -profilePath "D:\IBM_ND_7.0\WebSphere\AppServer\profiles\Custom01" -templatePath "D:\IBM_ND_7.0\WebSphere\AppServer\profileTemplates\managed" -nodeName customnode01 -hostName localhost -cellName mycustomcell01




To start a server using command line or using admin console
nodeagent must be running
to stop a server using admin console
nodeagent must be running
to stop a server using cmd line, nodeagent either running or stopped, we can stop a server


Federation
----------
Its a process of adding a node either from AppSrv Profile of Custom Profile to the dmgr cell
We can add a node by using a command
addNode.sh <host name of the dmgr> SOAP Connector port number of dmgr

At the time of federation, a process called nodeagent will be created to communicate between Dmgr and federated profile servers and applications.

Once nodes of application server profile and custom profile is federated to the dmgr, we can create multiple jvms under that nodes and we can do administration activities through the dmgr admin console

Cell 
----
A cell a top most component in a profile. Cell maintains master repository or master configuration. What ever the changes we do, initially the changes are updated in the master configuration, later that changes are synchronized with the node.
Node
----
A node is required to create jvms or a node holds jvms.
With out a valid node we can't create jvms


BAU, work arounds


Synchronization
---------------
The purpose of synchronization is to update the changes from cell to node.
We can do it 2 ways
	1. Command Line
	2. Admin Console

to synchronize a node using command line, first stop the nodeagent, then execute a command
syncNode.sh <host name of dmgr> <SOAP Connector port number of dmgr>


diff b/w sync (partial sync) and full sync
------------------------------------------
In Sync it transfers only the changed or updated configuration files from DMGR to the Node. It's Faster, because it skips unchanged files. We use it for regular operations when only a few files have been updated.

In full sync, transfers all configuration files, regardless of whether they have changed or not. It's slower, as it copies everything. We use it when Node is out of sync due to corruption or manual edits and ensuring a clean and complete sync.

command to take a backup with out stopping the servers
----------------------------------------------------
go to <WAS_ROOT>/bin>backupConfig.sh -nostop


to take a particular profile backup
<WAS_ROOT>/bin>backupConfig.sh -profileName <profile_name> -nostop

Connection URL for oracle
jdbc:oracle:thin:@localhost:1521:XE





Steps to configure WAS with Oracle
-----------------------------------
1. Create a JDBC provide
2. Create a data source
3. While creating a datasource, provide datasource name, JNDI name and connection url
4. Provide Database server username and pwd under j2c authentication
5. save the changes and test connection
6. if DB is configured successfully we will get a message teat connection was successful 


Troubleshooting DB Connectivity issues
--------------------------------------
1. Check the error messages in the log file, if the error messages are with netExceptions, network adapter exceptions, listerner refused 
  =>Now check the connectivity between jboss host and db host and also is the DB Server is running or not and port is opened or not
  => first I will execute ping remote ip to check the connectivity between two boxes, then execute telnet <remote host name /ip> port number of db server
 => if it's not connected I will tell DB team to check the status of DB Server and to open the port.
2. If we get java.sql.SQLException: invalid username/password; logon denied
  => Now check the user name and password given in the configuration
3. If we get an missing/unavailable dependencies jboss.driver-demander or class not found exceptions, check do we have proper jar files and proper driver classes in the jar file. 
4. Verify the connection url and database name
5. This is the way, I troubleshoot DB connectivity issues


jar
---
A jar is a collection of classes, at the time of configuring WAS with Oracle we need ojdbc8.jar. It contains driver classes, which helps to create connection objects

If jar is not properly configured we will get java.lang.classNotFoundException


1. Issue	  			
unable to connect to Oracle DB

Description : 
getting an error while configuring WAS with Oracle.
Below is the error message

The test connection operation failed for data source AmazonDS on server server1 at node apnode02test with the following exception: java.lang.ClassNotFoundException: DSRA8000E: No jar or zip files found in f:\softwares/ojdbc6.jar. View JVM logs for further details.

Solution
--------
As the error message is telling classNotFoundException, the respective classes are not available while connecting with the db.
The path is looking at F:\softwares, in this location, its looking for ojdbc6.jar.
But I have checked in the F:\softwares, ojdbc6.jar is not available.
That is the reason its throwing an error.
To troubleshoot this issues, either change the path to the proper location or copy the jar to F:\softwares


JVM logs

systemOut.log
systemErr.log
are called as jvm logs

for each and aver jvm or each and every server, we can find its own JVM logs
By default jvm logs are located in <profile_home>/logs/<servername>

2. Issue	  			
unable to connect to Oracle DB

Description : 
getting an error while configuring WAS with Oracle.
Below is the error message


The test connection operation failed for data source AmazonDS on server server1 at node apnode02test with the following exception: java.sql.SQLException: The Network Adapter could not establish the connectionDSRA0010E: SQL State = 61000, Error Code = 20. View JVM logs for further details.


Solution
--------
As the error message is telling The Network Adapter could not establish, check did we give exact ipaddress and portnumber of the DB

ping 192.20.134.23
reply

if I am getting replies

was host and Db host

telnet 192.20.134.23 1521
connected



Explain how to configure DS

delete server.xml
and startserver

2. Give wrong username/password
3. wrong ip
4. wrong url


In Express and base packages, we can create only application Server profile. We don't have a concept of federation.
It's difficult to manage multiple instances. If our requirement is to have 1 or 2 servers, we can use express or base packages. 
In production environment, in huge infrastructures it's difficult to manage.
So we prefer to go with Network Deployment Package
We don't have clustering and single point of Administration in Express and base packages

Express package is used in small to medium business applications
Express package is lower cost when compare to Base Package
1 JVM per Host is supported


Base package is used in medium to large business applications
Licensing cost is Higher than express package
multiple jvms are allowed but multiple appSrv profiles, multiple admin consoles, difficult to  manage



We can deploy one or more applications in appservers
But each application must have a unique context root

Context Root
------------
A context root is a unique to invoke or access the applications

Connection Pool
---------------
It contains pre-defined connection objects. If we have a connection pool, after completion of transactions, connection objects are back to the pool. That connection objects can be reused for further incoming request.
So that we will reduce the delay in the response.

Connection Pool Properties
--------------------------
1. Minimum Connections: It tells the minimum number of connection objects to be maintained, even though its in idle state. By default 1 is the minimum connection
2. Maximum Connection: It tells upto what extent a connection pool can grow. By default it's 10 connection objects
3. Unused Timeout: It tells the time interval, how long connection objects can be idle, before being closed. By default its 1800 seconds
4. Aged Timeout: It tells maximum time of a connection object with a request or life time of connection object with a request, By default its 0.
5. Reap Time: it's the time interval which tells, when the pool maintenance thread has to run across the pool to scan unused connection objects and aged timeout connection objects. Once it identifies any connection objects are matching to the time intervals of unused timeout and aged time out, it will take an action on that connection objects. It will decide, connection objects to be in  the pool or to be discarded from the pool. By default its 180 seconds
6. Connection Timeout: It tells maximum time a server can wait for a free connection object, before throwing an error (connectionwaittimeout exception), default is 180sec
7. Purge Policy: its tells what to do with connection objects, when there is an error
There are two purge policies
	1. Entire Pool
	2. Failing Connections Only

not properly synchronized

Cell profile

Dmgr01
AppSrv01


Deployment Manager Profile:
	It contains dmgrcell, admin console, dmgr process and supporting configuration files. Dmgr mainly helps to do administration activities on the federated profile servers and applications
It becomes operational, only after federation of appsrv profile or custom to the dmgr cell


Differences between Connection Pool Data Source and XA
or
Differences between non XA and XA Data Source


Non - XA
--------
It supports single phase commit
It supports local transactions
It is used when there is a single database
Transaction management is handled by the jdbc driver

XA Datasource
-------------
It supports global transactions or distributed transactions
It supports two phase commit
It is used when there are multiple databases or multiple resources involved in a transaction like JMS and DB
Transaction management is handled by Application servers Transaction manager


WSAdmin objects
--------------
There are 5 wsadmin objects
	1. AdminControl - start, stop, monitor servers
        2. AdminConfig  - Create JDBC, datasources, jms and updating configurations
        3. AdminApp     - Application deployment, uninstall, updating, application backup
        4. AdminTask    - Create servers, clusters and security updates
        5. Help         - It helps to check the options and usage of each object


wsadmin command to deploy application

AdminApp.install('/path/to/yourApp.ear', ['-appname', 'YourAppName', '-node', 'appnode01', '-server', 'server1'])
AdminConfig.save()

AdminApp.install('F:\softwares\sample_applications\PlantsByWebSphere.ear', ['-appname', 'plants', '-node', 'KrishnaWebNode01', '-server', 'server1'])

Global Security
---------------
It is to secure WAS environment, only authorized users can access admin console and perform administration activities.
We can configure global security in 4 ways
	1. LocalOS user registry
	2. Custom user registry
        3. LDAP user registry
        4. Federated repository
1. Steps to configure global security using Local OS registry
--------------------------------------------------------------
1. Create a user in your OS, assign passwd to the user
2. Login to admin console, expand security and select global security
3. Select security configuration wizard and select Local OS user registry
4. Provide the username and password
5. Confirm the password under LTPA authentication mechanism
6. Enable administrative security check box
7. Under available realm definitions, select Local OS and restart the server
8. Now we can access adminconsole using 
   https protocol
   https://ip:9043/ibm/console

Steps to apply fixpack
----------------------
1. Check the current version of WAS
2. Take backup of profiles, applications and WAS_ROOT backup
3. check the IM version, if its required update IM
 (./imcl install com.ibm.cic.agent -repositories /root/Desktop/agentinstall/extract1.9/repository.config -preferences offering.service.repositories.areUsed=false -acceptLicense -showprogress)
4. Download fixpack, we will get 3 zip bunles, extract all the 3 zip bundles
5. Find the fixpack package ID by using a command
./imcl listAvailablePackages -repositories /root/Desktop/softwares/fixpack/repository.config
6. Install fixpack by using imcl command
./imcl install com.ibm.websphere.ND.v85_8.5.5024.20230628_1659 -repositories /root/Desktop/softwares/fixpack/repository.config -installationDirectory /opt/IBM/WebSphere/AppServer -acceptLicense -showProgress
7. Once fixpack is installed successfully we can find the updated version number in 4 digit
8. Execute a command ./versionInfo.sh
9. StartServers and applications
